# Please Note

This project is published here to demonstrate my technical abilities to potential employers.

It was a project put together in my spare time in cooperation with a social project from Darmstadt.

After intentions and plans diverged within the social project, the platform project was put on ice.

> Please note: this is a private hobby project of mine, so the code quality is not quite as high as I would deliver in a professional context.

> The hosting of this service was configured in a another repository that included this repository as a submodule. This repository is not published. It contains the docker-compose configuration files. The frontend was hosted using Nginx, which provided a reverse proxy to the API.
